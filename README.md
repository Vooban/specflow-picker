**Notice** : SpecFlow Feature File Editor forked from Picker on CodePlex https://pickler.codeplex.com/

## Introduction ##
Pickler allows users to edit SpecFlow files to be written in the Gherkin language efficiently. This includes syntax highlighting and table reformatting so that it need not be done by hand.

Visual Studio with SpecFlow support will handles this functionality, however this tool is intended for use by those developing the testing plans without access to Visual Studio.
